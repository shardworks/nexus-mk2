/**
 * The Laboratory — public types.
 *
 * Two concerns live here:
 *
 *   1. The `trial` writ type configuration — its state machine, registered
 *      with the Clerk at startup. Mirrors the mandate lifecycle (`new →
 *      open → completed | failed | cancelled`, with `stuck` as a
 *      non-terminal "needs attention" state off `open`). Trials are leaves
 *      in v1 — the `experiment` parent type is reserved for v2 (see click
 *      c-momaacry).
 *
 *   2. The `ext.laboratory.config` schema — the structured trial
 *      configuration carried on every trial writ. Mirrors the YAML
 *      manifest shape exactly so the CLI's translation layer is a thin
 *      validator + post step.
 *
 * The legacy `LaboratoryConfig` (data-mirroring stub) is removed — that
 * plugin's no-op phase is over.
 *
 * See: experiments/infrastructure/setup-and-artifacts.md (the standalone-bash
 * spec the apparatus supersedes; its run.yaml shape is the template here).
