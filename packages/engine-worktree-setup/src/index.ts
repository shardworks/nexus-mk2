/**
 * Worktree Setup Engine
 *
 * Creates isolated git worktrees for commission sessions. When an anima is
 * dispatched to work on a commission, this engine:
 *
 * 1. Creates a new git branch for the commission
 * 2. Sets up a git worktree pointing at that branch
 * 3. Returns the worktree path so the manifest engine can launch the
 *    session in the correct working directory
 *
 * Worktrees provide isolation — each commission gets its own working copy
 * of the repo, so multiple animas can work concurrently without conflicts
 * in the working directory.
 *
 * ## Directory layout
 *
 * Commission worktrees are created from workshop bare clones:
 *
 *   GUILD_ROOT/
 *     .nexus/
 *       workshops/
 *         workshop-a.git/          ← bare clone (source for worktrees)
 *       worktrees/
 *         workshop-a/
 *           commission-42/         ← worktree for commission #42
 *         workshop-b/
 *           commission-17/         ← worktree for commission #17
